# Scenario - Course Enrolment App:
Tech-Geeks, a software development company in Auckland, specializes in creating software applications. Tech-Geeks have been approached by Hamilton school to develop a desktop application for student course enrolment. 
They are asking for a desktop application where a student can enrol into a course by filling all his personal details along with their expression of interest in a course. The enrolment form should offer them with current available course like IS, SD, ITTS, ITSA, CM. 
Client Requirements
The following are the client requirements for the project “Course-Enrolment-App”.
1.	Enrolment Form: The application should include a form where students can enter their details, such as:
•	First Name
•	Last Name
•	Date of Birth
•	Email Address
•	Gender
•	Phone Number
2.	Course Selection: Students should be able to select and enrol in courses available at the school. They can enrol in multiple courses, but only one course at a time.
3.	Display the selected courses on the screen: The application should display a list of courses the student has expressed interest in on the screen.
4.	Form Reset After Enrolment: After an enrolment request is submitted, the form should reset to empty, allowing the student to enrol in a new course.
5.	Delete Option for Courses: The application should include a delete button, allowing students to remove a specific course from their list of enrolled courses if they wish to drop out of course.
These features will help streamline the enrolment process for students at Hamilton school, providing a user-friendly and efficient solution for course registration.
